##  Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect: Design for Cost Optimization
##########################################################################
Data does not leave an Azure region unless specifically executed to.


## Designing The Things That Cost Money In The Cloud
##
 - Services: VM (service tier, size, power, etc. )
        1GB RAM / 2 Cores    vs.  32 GB RAM / 16 Cores

 - Storage: Size:  GB, TB, PB,
            Performance Tier:  Hot, Cool Archive

 - Network Traffic:  ingress free, egress $$

 - Software licenses :
    -- could be included in service (Windows VM)
    -- per user: Office 365 License


## Managing and Reporting Costs
##

 - Azure Cost Management & Billing
    - Free tool: analyze costs and manage invoices
    Billing:
        - Invoices
        - Payment methods
        - Billing address
        - Tax ID

    Cost Management:
        - Cost Analysis:  resource type, location, tags, subscription, name, etc.
        - Budgets : set limits on scopes:
              - subscription / resource group
        - Alerts :
        - Connect to AWS : manage costs on both clouds
        - Export billing data

NOTE ON Budgets:
  - can set budget on subscription or resource groups
      - Alerts sent when % of budget hit
      - NO SERVICES STOPPED !!


Spending Limit on Subscription level CAN STOP SERVICES !!!


 - Azure Advisors
  - Gives Recommendations in performance, security, availability and COSTS
    - Recommendations about costs



## Reducing Costs
##

 - General Cost Reductions
 - Discounts
 - Azure spot VMs
 - Reserved Capacity
 - Bring your own license
 - Auto start / stop


 # General Cost Reductions
  - Scale to right sized tiers
  - Create policies
      - created on resource tiers that can be created (basic, etc.)
  - Cleanup unused resources
  - Automatically scale down or in services when not being used

 # Discounts
  - Azure credits for Visual Studio subscribers
  - Use Microsoft managed services provider (MSP)
        - Manages Azure subscription for you
        - Offer discount on Azure services

  - Enterprise Agreement

 # Azure spot VMs
  - can get a discount of upto 90%
  - Azure evicts VM
        - When it needs capacity
        - and/or when VM instance goes over agreed upon price
  - Azure either stops or deletes VM (determined by you)

NOTE: VMs w/ Spot enabled have no SLA (can be stopped at any time)

 # Reserved Capacity
  - reserved capacity for a specific sku
  - 1 to 3 years
  - Reduced price
      - VMs, Storage, Databases, etc.
  - Paid upfront or monthly
      - Cancel or exchange anytime

 # Bring your own license
  - Must have licenses w/ Software Assurance
  - Windows server / SQL Server, etc.

 # Auto Start and Stop

  - Automatically stop on schedule
  - Azure DevTest Labs
  - Azure Kubernetes Service : start / stop cluster
  - Azure Synapse Analytics  : pause and resume compute



## Access Tiers
##
 - Can change access tiers to storage
  - can change individual blobs: Hot, Cool, Archive
  - can change storage account default: Hot or Cool (not Archive)

  - Hot: Fastest and most expensive

  - Cool: store at least 30 days  ***
    - Less expense
    - Cheaper storage costs
    - Higher access costs

  - Archive: store at least 180 days  ***
    - Least expensive
    - slowest (offline storage)
        - hourse to rehydrate
    - cheapest storage costs
    - highest access costs

Can automate via Tracking (version for blobs) and  Lifecycle management
   - rule to move blobs from hot to cool or archive


## Reduce VM Costs
##

 - Spot Tiers
    - Eviction Type:
        - Capacity only
        - Price of Capacity

    - Eviction Policy:
        - Stop / Deallocate
        - Delete

 - Bring Your Own License (BYOL)
    aka Azure Hybrid Benefit
    NOTE: Must have Windows Server License w/ Software Assurance

 - Auto shtudown
    - shutdown during specified times


## Azure Policy
##

 - Create policies to control costs
    - create policy to restrict VM skus
    - assign policy to management or resource group
